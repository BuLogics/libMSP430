;                specified FLASH area

; Funclet parameters:
;
;   Parameter       Register
;   =========       ========
;   Address         R5
;   Size            R6
;   LockA           R8
;   Type            R9
;
;   General Purpose Registers used by funclet
;   =========================================
;   R10             Memory pointer
;   R11             Compare register/Outer loop counter
;   R12             Inner delay loop counter
;
;   Funclet memory map
;   ==================
;   The Funclet uses a very specific memory map, so that the debugger can check
;   for specific values on the MAB to track the progress of the funclet. The
;   following table documents this memory map:
;
;   Section:        Location:       Number of Words:
;   --------        ---------       ----------------
;   Initialization  0000h - 001Eh   16 words
;   WaitforDeadLoop 0020h - 0026h    4 words
;   CodeBody        0028h - 005Ah   26 words
;   Stop            005Ch            1 word
;   ControlWord     005Eh            1 word
;                                   ================
;   Total:                          48 words (96 bytes)
;
;   UserData        0060h - xxxxh   16 words in worst case device
