Rev 3.2.1.009
========================================================================

   !NOTE this an all new DLL design!
   The DLL version 3.2.1.9 is an all new DLL design compared to
   the last DLL version 2.9.4.1. This new DLL includes also a new
   UIF-Firmware. Furthermore the USB driver has been changed to a
   certified CDC driver.
   The DLL is implemented in C++ and follows a object base
   design, which is host operating system independent .
   The API of the new DLL is the same as for the old one.
   DLL functionality keeps the same as in the old V2 DLL.
   The new DLL V3 also includes a compiled version of the DLL v2.
   For more details please see www.ti.com/mspds

   The new CDC drivers and other imported information about the new UIF
   firmware update could be found in MSP430_DLL_Devopers guide, which
   is part of this packet.

   New device support:
   CC430F6147 - 8 devices
   -F6147, F6145, F6143, F5147, F5145, F5143, F5125, F5123

   Known Limitations:
   -   LPMx.5 debugging is not fully functional.
   -   After wakeup from LPMx.5, MSP430_Run is not functional
       Workaround: None
   -   If you unplug the USB FET during an active debug session,
       the session could be interrupted and the IDE could stop working
   -   Cycle Counter not functional
       Workaround: None
   -   EEM not fully supported (Trace/Sequencer/variable watch)

       in certain cases
       Workaround: None
   -   Old UIF version (v1.3) firmware update not fully automated due
       to Hardware limitation
       Workaround: An manual reset has to be done during major UIF
